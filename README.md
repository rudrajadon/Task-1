# Task 1

## Folders

### 1. **AIvsReal**
This folder contains the following files:

- **Classifier Model Script**: The script to train the classifier model.
- **Trained Model**: The pre-trained model file that can be used for making predictions.

### 2. **GAN**
This folder includes the following:

- **GAN_Mnist.ipynb**: The training script for the GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) model, which was used to train on the MNIST dataset.

#### Sub-folder: **cycleGAN**
The **cycleGAN** sub-folder contains:

- **Model Script**: The script defining the CycleGAN model.
- **Generated Images**: The images generated during the training process of the CycleGAN model.

> **Note**: I could not find suitable dataset for the Xmas theme, I trained the CycleGAN model for **horse-to-zebra image conversion** instead. The model was trained on this task and images were generated accordingly.
